# Images-to-3D-model
A script to turn a set of images into a 3D model in OBJ format, originally written to turn images from a CT scan into a 3D model.

images2model.py is the program that actually does the work of converting the images to a 3D model, and imageSaver.py was a custom script that I used to automate saving the images from the Philips DICOM Viewer application.
